{"name":"UDPdatagram Heatmap","tagline":"Integrating the heatmap within Ushahidi","body":"Getting Started\r\n=================\r\nUshahidi Platform is humanitarian open source software for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping. It is used to build tools for democratizing information, increasing transparency and lowering the barriers for individuals to share their stories. For this project we have integrated a heatmap plugin into the Ushahidi platform. The heatmap plugin was taken from David Kobia's heatmap plugin.\r\nThe heatmap plugin is used to display all active reports from Ushahidi onto a map. It displays its own heatmap on a different page and shows all the reports as a whole, without the user capability of changing the view/category. For our project, we integrated the heatmap into the main ushahidi map, thus, giving users a chance to switch the view/categories and toggle the heatmap. In addition, we allow the admin a choice to enable or disable the heatmap in the admin dashboard. \r\n\r\nWhat the project is useful\r\n-------------------\r\nDuring crisis situations this project will provide critical information to identify areas of great concern. Through Ushahidi, local observers can submit incidents using their mobile phones or the internet, while simultaneously creating a heatmap of events as they happen. Using the heatmap is simple, users can toggle between the original reports layer on/off, depending on their preference.  The heatmap can be used as an additional information cue for people to display geospatial archive of events. User can select different categories to display a heatmap of the incidents.\r\n\r\nUsing the Heatmap \r\n-------------------\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/9SLXQtd.png?1sZ)\r\nFigure 1: Displaying the heatmap and reports\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/k8BXVW7.png?1)\r\nFigure 2: Toggle off the heatmap\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/rqrCYpE.png?1)\r\nFigure 3: Heatmap changes to \"Under Attack\" category\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ZAn9kk3.png?1)\r\nFigure 5: Admin setting to enable/disable the heatmap\r\n\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n-------------------\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
